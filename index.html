          Step 01: Preheat oven to 350°. Cream peanut butter and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in egg and vanilla. <br>
          Step 02: Roll into 1-1/4-in. balls. Place 2 in. apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake until tops are slightly cracked, 10-12 minutes. Immediately press 1 chocolate kiss into center of each cookie. Cool for 5 minutes before removing from pans to wire racks. <br>

          Step 01: Heat oil in wok or large fry pan over high heat. <br>
          Step 02: Add garlic and stir fry for 10 seconds or until it starts to turn golden - don't let it burn!<br>
          Step 03: Add chicken and stir fry until the surface gets a tinge of browning but inside is still raw - about 1 minute.<br>
          Step 04: Add the cabbage, carrot, and the white pieces of shallots (i.e. from the base of the stalk). Stir fry for 1 1/2 minutes until the cabbage is mostly wilted.<br>
          Step 05: Add the noodles, Sauce and water*. Stir fry for 1 minute, tossing constantly. <br>
          Step 06: Add bean sprouts and remaining shallots/scallions. Toss through for 30 seconds or until the bean sprouts just start to wilt.<br>
          Step 07: Remove from heat and serve immediately.

      <div class="recipe" id="panel03">
        <p>
          Step 01: In a small bowl, mix first 4 ingredients together until a thin paste forms. Coat the roast evenly on all sides with the paste. Season the roast generously with salt and pepper. Allow the roast to stand at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes before grilling.<br>
          Step 02: Prepare the grill for indirect cooking over medium heat (about 400 degrees).<br>
          Step 03: Brush the cooking grates clean. Drain and add the wood chips on top of the charcoal and close the lid. When the wood begins to smoke, place the roast on the grill, bone side down, over indirect medium heat. Cook with the lid closed as much as possible, until the internal temperature reaches 120 to 125 degrees for medium-rare, about 1 ½ hours.<br>
          Step 04: Remove the roast from the grill, cover loosely with foil, and let rest about 20 minutes. Cut the roast into thick slices and serve immediately. <br>

      <div class="recipe" id="panel04">
        <p>
          Step 01: In a small saucepan over medium heat, cook and stir almonds and sugar until almonds are coated and lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Spread the almonds on heavy-duty foil to cool; gently bread apart.<br>
          Step 02: In a large salad bowl, combine romaine, oranges, celery and onions. Top with almonds. In a jar with tight-fitting lid, combine the dressing ingredients; shake well. Pour over the salad and toss gently.<br>

      <div class="box" id="flip05"><a class="titles" href="#">Chicken Curry</a></div>
      <div class="recipe" id="panel05">
        <p>
          Step 01: Thinly slice the spring onions, reserving a handful of the sliced green parts for garnish. Peel and chop the garlic. Heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat and cook the spring onions and garlic for a few minutes. Add the tomatoes, curry powder and ground ginger and cook for 3-4 minutes. If the pan gets dry add a splash of water and make sure the spices don't burn.<br>
          Step 02: Add the chicken and cook for 5 minutes. Make sure all the chicken is coated and is beginning to brown on the sides.<br>
          Step 03: Add 250ml/9fl oz water and bring to the boil. Reduce to a medium to low heat and cook for 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through with no sign of pink juices in the middle of the pieces.<br>
          Step 04: While the chicken is cooking, prepare the rice. Pour the rice into a saucepan and rinse it under the cold tap to take away any cloudy starch. Drain the cloudy water away. Add clean water for cooking the rice. You need almost twice as much water as rice. (If you use a mug of rice, add a little less than two mugs of water). Bring to the boil then reduce the heat to a low simmer. Cover with a lid and cook very gently for 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and leave to stand with the lid on for 10 minutes. This will finish cooking the rice. Keeping the lid on is important, so none of the steam escapes.<br>
          Step 05: Take the curry off the heat, stir in the yoghurt then season with salt and pepper. Serve the curry with the rice and garnish with a drizzle of yoghurt.<br>
